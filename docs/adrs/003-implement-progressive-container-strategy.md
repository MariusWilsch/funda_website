# 003: Implement Progressive Container Strategy for Mobile Optimization

## Status
**Accepted** | Date: 2025-01-07

## Context
- Mobile overflow issues were occurring across multiple website sections, causing content to extend beyond viewport boundaries and lose right padding
- Inconsistent container strategies between sections: some used `max-w-7xl` while others used `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-5xl`
- Mobile-first design requirements demanded proper content constraint on devices as small as 320px (Mobile S)
- Luxury aesthetic needed preservation across all breakpoints while ensuring mobile usability
- Custom breakpoint system (`xs: '475px'`) required unified implementation across all components
- User reports of horizontal scrollbars and poor mobile experience on service, FAQ, and booking sections
- Need for maintainable, scalable responsive design pattern for future development

## Decision
We will implement a universal progressive container strategy across all major website sections.

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Section Level: Progressive Padding
     ↓
Container Level: Progressive Max-Width
     ↓
Content Level: Proper Constraint
```

**Progressive Container Pattern:**
```jsx
// Universal pattern for all sections
<section className="py-20 px-3 xs:px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <div className="max-w-sm xs:max-w-md sm:max-w-4xl md:max-w-6xl lg:max-w-7xl mx-auto">
    {/* Section content */}
  </div>
</section>
```

**Breakpoint Strategy:**

| Breakpoint | Container Max-Width | Padding | Target Device | Available Content Width |
|------------|-------------------|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Default | max-w-sm (384px) | px-3 (12px) | Mobile S (320px) | 296px |
| xs (475px) | max-w-md (448px) | px-4 (16px) | Mobile XL | 443px |
| sm (640px) | max-w-4xl (896px) | px-6 (24px) | Tablet | 592px |
| md (768px) | max-w-6xl (1152px) | px-6 (24px) | Tablet L | 720px |
| lg (1024px) | max-w-7xl (1280px) | px-8 (32px) | Desktop | 960px |

**Completion Criteria:**
- All major sections (Services, FAQ, Booking, Contact, Footer) use progressive container pattern
- Zero horizontal overflow on any device from 320px to 1920px+
- Consistent spacing rhythm maintained across all breakpoints
- Luxury aesthetic preserved on desktop while ensuring mobile usability

**Implementation Specifics:**
- Replace all fixed `max-w-7xl`, `max-w-6xl` containers with progressive pattern
- Standardize padding progression: `px-3 xs:px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Maintain existing vertical spacing patterns
- Apply to: ServicesSection, FAQSection, BookingSection, ContactSection, Footer

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Unified mobile experience eliminates content overflow across all sections
- Consistent design language establishes foundation for scalable design system
- Improved mobile usability with proper touch targets and readability
- Better performance through reduced layout thrashing and proper content constraint
- Enhanced accessibility with appropriate spacing and content width
- Maintainable pattern reduces future responsive design complexity

### ❌ Negative
- Increased CSS complexity with more verbose responsive utility classes
- Learning curve for team members to understand progressive container concept
- Potential CSS bundle size increase due to additional Tailwind utilities
- Maintenance overhead to ensure all new components follow established pattern
- Migration effort required for existing components not yet updated

### ⚪ Neutral
- Documentation requirements for pattern consistency across team
- Testing requirements across all defined breakpoints and devices
- Design review process adaptation to consider progressive constraints
- Component library updates to include reusable container patterns

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejection Reason |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Fixed Container Approach** | Continued use of `max-w-7xl` would not solve mobile overflow issues |
| **CSS Grid/Flexbox Solution** | More complex implementation without clear responsive breakpoint control |
| **Component-Specific Solutions** | Would perpetuate inconsistency and increase maintenance burden |
| **CSS Container Queries** | Limited browser support and unnecessary complexity for current requirements |
| **Viewport-Based Units (vw/vh)** | Unpredictable behavior across devices and poor content constraint control |
