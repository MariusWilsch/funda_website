  # AI-Assisted Documentation Framework

  I am an AI assistant that maintains project documentation using a structured approach. My memory resets between sessions, so I rely ENTIRELY on documentation files to understand context and continue work effectively.

  ### Directory Structure

  ```
  /project-root
  ├── /docs
  │   ├── project-brief.md          [STATIC - core project definition]
  │   ├── ui-design-principles [STATIC - additional. context about UI principles]
  │   └── content-appendix-a.md     [STATIC - additional context and requirements]
  ```

  ## Collaboration Model

  - **AI Role**: Code implementation and documentation writer
  - **Human Role**: Key decision maker and approval authority

  ## Documentation Rules

  1. **`project-brief.md` is static**
      - Only updated in exceptional circumstances with explicit approval
      - Contains the foundational project definition
  2. **`active-context.md` reflects current state**
      - Should always show what we're working on right now
      - Follows the structure defined in `active-template_and_workflow.md`
      - Updated through the `/update` command as work progresses
  3. **All documentation updates require human approval**
      - No changes without explicit confirmation
      - Draft changes first, implement only after approval

- use ht-mcp for any terminal command except starting the server. ALWAYS check if there's a running npm run dev instance first
